# Compatible Plugins & Tools

The following is a list of plugins that utilize and are compatible with the WordPress REST API v2. Some plugins may be more intended for development purposes and others for production environments. Code quality is also highly variant. While WordPress REST API v2 is still in plugin form, most of these plugins use it as a dependency, as opposed to the core infrastructure introduced in WordPress 4.4, so make sure you have it installed and activated.
